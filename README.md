This is an on going project to try and esitamte the outcomes in battle in the TTRPG system Pathfinder 2e. I take Jsons from pathbuilder2e and the module from pf2e from foundry and build the characters to test out how they would do in combat. My plan is to implement a way to 
add a value to certain actions in combat to see what ones are the most effective in them.
